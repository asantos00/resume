    "summary": "I'm a software engineer passionate about products and startups. For the last 8+ years, I've been working together with multiple companies, using technology as an enabler for ideas and businesses. With a big interest in education and getting people excited about technology, I makes sure I'm always involved with people that are learning about it, being it via blog posts, books, open source contributions, or meetups. This is, by itself, a learning adventure that I loves to be a part of. Being a true believer that great software only happens through collaboration, ownership, and teams of great people, I strives to nurture those values in every project he works in.",

They surprise you, not only for their hard skills, but mainly for the soft skills and for the people they really are. \n Well, Alexandre is simply, one of the most incredible people I had the pleasure to work with and I am lucky enough to keep talking and be with him often. I have always something to learn with him and it's a real pleasure to feel his amazing energy. It's contagious...much more than Covid19. \n Alexandre is not only a fast learner and a fantastic coder with a natural talent to communicate, but he is, mainly, a strategical thinker, an innate curious mind and a super intelligent and driven person. \n Apart from that, he has a great humor, is a huge team player and the kind of person everyone wants to be around with. \n It was and it is an honor to call him friend and to have him as one of our advisors at Agroop. Keep sharing and showing your magic. I will be always paying attention ;)",
